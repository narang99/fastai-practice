    "## Differentiation as an operator\n",
    "\n",
    "`d/dx` can be thought of as an operator that maps a function `f(x)` (single input variable) to its derivate `f'(x)`. This results in more intuitive and easier handling of derivates.\n",

    "\n",
    "A function `f(x,y)` (multiple parameters) can be differentiated using the help of partial derivates.  \n",
    "A partial derivate with respect to `x` will give the change in `f(x,y)` w.r.t `x` **keeping** `y` **constant**  \n",
    "**NOTE:** Partial derivates are commonly called partials\n",
    "\n",
    "In vector calculas, all partials of a function are organized in a vector format. This is called a **gradient**\n"
